 🔦 BlinkLit Dashboard Project Overview

BlinkLit Dashboard is a dynamic data visualization platform designed to monitor and analyze blink detection in real time. Built using Python, OpenCV, and Streamlit, the dashboard captures facial landmarks, detects eye blinks using aspect ratio algorithms, and displays meaningful insights through interactive visual elements. The goal is to assist in applications such as driver drowsiness detection, attention tracking, or healthcare monitoring.

Key Features:

* 👁️ Real-time blink detection using webcam input
* 📊 Live dashboard powered by Streamlit
* 🧠 Intelligent blink frequency analysis using facial landmark models
* 📁 Exportable reports for further analysis
* 🔒 Lightweight and privacy-friendly (no external cloud storage)

 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of the **BlinkLit Dashboard** is to develop a lightweight, real-time application that accurately detects and monitors eye blinks using facial landmarks and visualizes the results through an interactive dashboard. By combining computer vision techniques with a user-friendly interface, this project aims to support use cases such as drowsiness detection, cognitive load assessment, and health monitoring — enabling timely insights and actionable responses in both personal and professional environments.
